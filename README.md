### Choosing Doubly Linked Nodes
Our Deque will be doubly linked nodes based because it has the fastest runtime. Although ArrayList is simpler to implement
since it has many similar methods. However adding to the front would be a linear runtime, while all the methods using doubly linked nodes would be constant runtime.

### methods
* addFirst()
* removeFirst()
* getFirst()
* addLast()
* removeLast()
* getLast()

### Development Plan
1. List the important methods to be implemented
2. Write the Deque interface
3. Implement the methods from Deque in QQKachoo using doubly linked nodes.
4. Create a driver class to test QQKachoo
5. Update the README.md for changes

### To Do List:
- [ ] update README with team information
- [ ] Consult the Java API for queue and deque
- [ ] Plan what methods to include
- [ ] implement methods in QQKachoo
- [ ] Create Driver file
- [ ] test methods and add comments
- [ ] update the README
